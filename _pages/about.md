I'm Sean, a young researcher in the field of biophysics. Currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Quantitative Life Sciences at McGill University, I have a strong academic background with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Biology, complemented by a minor in Mathematics.

I am investigating biophysical questions using mathematical and computational methods. From building simulations to analyzing protein structures and developing generative modeling frameworks, I am passionate about applying computational tools to advance our understanding of biological phenomena in the cell. 

When I'm not in the lab, you can find me on the trails skiing or reading/watching Stephen King!
